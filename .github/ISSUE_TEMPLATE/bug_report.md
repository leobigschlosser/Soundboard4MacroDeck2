**Describe the bug & how To Reproduce**
The addddon worked perfectly fine. But then i tryed to add audio categories and did not name  it but still assigned one of the tracks to it. But now each time i try to add a new track i get a bug repport (see title). and this error keeps popping up oer and over effectively stun locking me into clicking the ok box. I have  to kill  macro deck 2 and restart it to get out of it. I tryed clearing the pluggin , uninstalling macro dedck and installing it again. I tryed to reinstal window to clear any residual corryupt code to get a new clea install. In thoses cases the soudn libraries are empty  but as soon as i addd a new sound the box pop up and its all over again. BUT the sound i added works despite the error message so wtf is this ? 
It tells me to clear this default  message  i have to treat the dataerror event??? im lost (not beeing  able to code) .  Help  ?
